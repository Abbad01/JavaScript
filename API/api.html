    /*ðŸ”· What is an API?
API stands for Application Programming Interface.
It is a set of rules and protocols that allows one software application to communicate with another.

Think of an API as a messenger that takes requests, tells a system what to do, and returns the response.

ðŸ”¹ Why Do We Use APIs?
To access data or services from another system or app.

To separate frontend and backend code in web applications.

To enable modular development where different teams work on different parts (e.g., one on UI, another on backend).

To use third-party services like:

Weather APIs (get current weather)

Google Maps API

Payment APIs (Stripe, PayPal)

Social login APIs (Google, Facebook)

ðŸ”¸ Types of APIs
1. Web APIs
These are exposed over the web using HTTP/HTTPS protocols.

Example:
GET https://api.example.com/users

2. Library APIs
Provided by libraries (e.g., DOM API in JavaScript). You use them locally within your app.

Example:
document.querySelector('#btn')

3. Operating System APIs
Used to interact with OS-level features (e.g., file system, devices).
